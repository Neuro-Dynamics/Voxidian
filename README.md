AI Transcript — Obsidian Plugin (MVP)

Record audio, transcribe via Groq Whisper, optionally postprocess with OpenAI, and insert the result at the cursor.

Features
- Ribbon mic button + command (`Mod+Shift+M`) to start.
- Recording modal with timer, Stop & Transcribe, Discard.
- Postprocessing toggle + preset dropdown.
- Inserts at cursor or replaces selection (configurable).
- Settings for Groq/OpenAI keys, models, presets, and behavior.

Requirements
- Obsidian v1.5.0+ (desktop recommended).
- Groq API Key for transcription.
- Optional: OpenAI API Key for postprocessing.

Build
1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended)
2. Install deps: `npm install`
3. Build: `npm run build`

Install to Vault
Copy the following files into your vault’s plugins folder (e.g., `.obsidian/plugins/voxidian/`):
- `manifest.json`
- `main.js` (generated by build)
- `styles.css`

Then enable the plugin in Settings → Community plugins.

Settings
- Groq Whisper: API key, model (default: `whisper-large-v3`), optional language.
- OpenAI: API key, model (default: `gpt-4o-mini`).
- Postprocessing: enable-by-default, presets (name, system prompt, temperature, optional model override) with default preset selection.
- Recording & Insertion: show modal, max duration, insert vs replace, add newlines before/after.

Privacy
- Audio is kept in memory only and sent to the selected API(s) upon Stop.
- Keys are stored locally in vault plugin data.
- No transcripts or audio are logged by default.

Notes
- If OpenAI postprocessing fails, the raw Groq transcript is used.
- Mobile support is not tested; desktop-only in manifest.
